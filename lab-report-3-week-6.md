### Group Choice 1 - Streamline `ssh` Configuration

I created a custom nickname to the ieng6 server at ucsd. I made the nickname to be `cse15l`. When I went into `.ssh/`, I did not have a config file, so I created it using the command `vim config`.

I just used vim since it was just a couple lines to paste in, and I had to create the file anyways.

Now when I run `ssh cse15l`, I can log in to the serverâ€”no need to memorize the username and hostname for the server.

I decided to `scp` the file called `dummyfile` from my computer to the remote server. I simply ran `scp dummyfile cse15l` in the directory that contained the file.

In my ssh server, I found my file was copied over.
